# SOSA – Stay One Step Ahead

**Continuous Automated Red Teaming.  
The future of offensive defence.**

---

### 🔍 What is SOSA?

**SOSA (Stay One Step Ahead)** is a **Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART)** and **External Attack Surface Management (EASM)** platform designed to simulate real-world attackers at scale.

It maps, tracks, and targets everything your organisation exposes to the internet—**domains, APIs, cloud assets, people, codebases, credentials, and misconfigurations**—then autonomously executes attack simulations to show how an actual breach would occur.

SOSA isn't a scanner.  
It's a **modular offensive framework** that operates continuously.  
Designed by red team operators.  
Backed by automation.  
Enhanced by AI.

### ⚙️ Core Architecture

SOSA is composed of the following integrated subsystems:

- **Reconnaissance Workers**  
  Asset discovery and enrichment using open-source intelligence, custom fingerprinting, and organisational context.

- **Attack Workers**  
  Exploit modules powered by private and public vulnerability templates, logic bugs, misconfig detections, and chained attack paths.

- **AI-Augmented Decisioning**  
  Machine-driven correlation and prioritisation—not just what’s exposed, but what’s exploitable.

- **Human Attribution Modules**  
  Deanonymisation of developers and staff through GitHub, npm, SwaggerHub, and more—turning exposed infrastructure into targeted identities.

- **Private Intel and Exploit Packs**  
  Custom 0days, high-impact N-days, and logic chains maintained by offensive researchers.

- **Live Delta Tracking**  
  Tracks exposure changes across time—what’s new, what’s gone, and what’s still vulnerable.

### 🎯 Designed For Offense. Deployed For Defence.

Most security tooling is built by people who’ve never broken anything.  
SOSA was built by people who have—and decided to use that knowledge to protect.

- **Attack yourself daily, not quarterly.**  
- **No contextless alerts. Only actionable breaches.**  
- **No waiting for threat actors to tell you what matters.**

This is not simulation.  
This is what a breach looks like—**before it happens.**

### 🔥 Use Cases

- Continuous Red Teaming (CART)  
- External Attack Surface Management (EASM)  
- Phishing Surface Enumeration  
- API & Cloud Misconfiguration Detection  
- Developer Exposure & Supply Chain Monitoring  
- Code-Aware Exploit Path Planning  
- Pre-Breach Narrative Testing (“What story would an attacker write?”)

---

### 🚨 Why SOSA?

Because most “security” platforms only show you what they’ve seen before.  
SOSA shows you what an attacker sees the **moment they first look at you.**

You can’t patch what you don’t know.  
And you won’t stop an adversary using tools built for compliance.

### 🛡 Built by Offense, for Modern Defence

SOSA is developed by a collective of offensive operators, red teamers, and security engineers who understand that modern defenders need more than dashboards—they need leverage.

If your security tools are still reactive,  
**SOSA exists to make you proactive.**
